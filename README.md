Automated Crane–Conveyor–Vehicle System (ACCVS)

We are a team two from Kuopio and Dimple Dimple, Henrietta Okafor from Joensuu, are builing this robotics project uses the Webots simulator to design, develop and test an automated robots system consist from a crane, a conveyor belt, and a vehicle. The goal of the project is to show how different robotics with different sensors can work together in a repetitive flow.

First, the robotic crane picks up an object from the ground. The crane then places the object onto a conveyor belt, which moves it forward to the position where the vehicle is waiting. After the object reaches the end of the conveyor belt, the vehicle will detect the incoming object and then pushes the object back toward the crane’s starting position.

Once the object returns to the crane, the same process starts again. This repeated cycle helps demonstrate basic robotics concepts such as movement control, coordination between robots, and automation. By using Webots, the project allows safe testing, visualization, and improvement of the system before applying it to real-world robotics applications.

Our source code will be shared on GitHub for collaboration between two campuses. We can design, develop, fixing bugs and release remotely. We form a Discord server for discussions related to the project design, planning and use Google Meet whenever need a technical call (it has better call quality).
